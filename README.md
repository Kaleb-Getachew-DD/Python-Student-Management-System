# Student Management System

## Overview

The **Student Management System** is a Python-based command-line application designed to manage student records. It allows users to perform various operations, such as registering new students, searching for students, updating their details, and displaying a list of all students. The application interacts with a file (`student_db.txt`) to store and retrieve student data.

## Features

The system provides the following functionalities:

1. **Register a New Student**: 
   - Input student details such as ID, name, GPA, department, and gender.
   - Ensures no duplicate IDs are registered.
   - Validates GPA input (between 0 and 4).

2. **Search for a Student**: 
   - Search for a student by their ID and display their details.

3. **Update Student GPA**: 
   - Modify the GPA of an existing student by their ID.
   - Validates the updated GPA.

4. **Update Student Name**: 
   - Change the name of a student based on their ID.

5. **Display All Students**: 
   - Lists all students with their details (ID, Name, Gender, Department, GPA).

6. **Delete a Student**: 
   - Removes a student from the database using their ID.

7. **Count and Display Total Number of Students**: 
   - Displays the total number of students registered in the system.

8. **Count Total Number of Male and Female Students**: 
   - Shows the total count of male and female students.

9. **Display Top Scorer in Each Department**: 
   - Shows the top-scoring student in a given department.

10. **Display Top Female Scorer in Each Department**: 
   - Shows the top-scoring female student in a specific department.

11. **List Students Above a Given GPA**: 
   - Lists all students who have a GPA greater than a specified value.

12. **Show Frequent Student Names**: 
   - Displays the names of students that appear more than once in the system.

13. **Show Total Number of Students in Each Department**: 
   - Displays the total number of students in a specified department.

14. **Exit**: 
   - Exits the application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- A text file named `student_db.txt` (automatically created if it doesn't exist).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-management-system.git
   cd student-management-system
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   python student_management_system.py
   ```

3. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**:
   - The program will display a menu where you can select from various options.
   - Enter the corresponding number to select an action (e.g., "1" to register a new student).

## Example

1. **Registering a New Student**:
   ```
   Select your choice
   1. Register a new student
   Enter the number of students: 1
   Enter student id: 101
   Enter student name: John Doe
   Enter student GPA: 3.5
   Enter the department: Computer Science
   Enter student gender (M/F): M
   Registered successfully.
   ```

2. **Searching for a Student**:
   ```
   Select your choice
   2. Search for a student
   Enter student ID to search: 101
   ##### Data found ###########
   Name: John Doe, GPA: 3.5, Gender: M
   ```

## Error Handling

The program handles various input errors, including:
- Invalid menu selection.
- Invalid GPA input.
- Duplicate student IDs.

## File Structure

- **`student_management_system.py`**: Main script that contains all the functionality of the Student Management System.
- **`student_db.txt`**: A text file used to store student records (automatically created).

## Future Enhancements

- Support for multiple file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- More advanced search and filter capabilities.
- GUI-based interface.
